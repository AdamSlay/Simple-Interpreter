# This project is based on "Let's Build a Simple Interpreter" by Ruslan Spivak
[link to upstream project](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)

In this repo I will begin by following along with Ruslan's blog series in Python,
but along the way I will be trying to solve the various hurdles on my own before 
reading Ruslan's solution. After trying it on my own, I will read through their
solution and adjust what I need to in order to continue to follow along. After 
completing this assignment in Python, I will be going back through this entire 
thing in C++ and attempting to do everything without viewing the solutions prior 
to my attempt.
